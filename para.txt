The human species is very likely to go extinct before reaching a “posthuman” stage.
Any posthuman civilization is extremely unlikely to run a significant number of simulations of their evolutionary history.
We are almost certainly living in a computer simulation if the first two propositions are false
The rapid advancement of computing technology suggests that future civilizations might have the capability to run detailed simulations of their ancestors
Certain unexplained phenomena, such as quantum mechanics, could be better understood if we consider the possibility that our reality is a simulation.
The energy and computational resources required to simulate an entire universe are likely to be beyond the capabilities of any civilization.
The hypothesis is seen by some as a modern take on philosophical skepticism, offering no practical way to prove or disprove its claims.
